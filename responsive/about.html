   <h2>Food</h2>
   <p> Food is one of the keystones of Italian culture and even when life becomes busy Italians still find a great pleasure in sitting at their dining table or at a restraunt. Which is counter to American fast food culture. We do not have time with our fast pace lives to sit down and enjoy a meal. Maybe this is why Italians are happier with life that Americans.
