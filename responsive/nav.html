   <h2> Nearby Day Trips</h2>
   <p>If you are interested in seeing areas outside of Florence by bus we are happy to help you plan that day trip! All of the main ciites have their own bus company and they run all the buses across the region. We even offer to make lunch reservations along the way so that you can get a taste of different cuisine along the way. Everyone on social media will be so jealous of your food blog along the way. We also help set up vineyard tours if you are interested in checking that out. We hope you consider booking a day trip with us.
