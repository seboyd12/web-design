   <h3> Passport Information </h3>
   <p>Most important tip, when traveling abroad you must confirm the validity of your passport. Keep in mind that in order for many countries to allow you entry, your passport must be valid for at least six months (some only three months) from the date of your arrival. Even if you are only visiting for a day, you run the risk of not being allowed admission if your passport does not have at least six months remaining on it.
