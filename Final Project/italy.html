   <h2> Local Cruisine</h2>
   <p>Italian food is a reason for pride in the country. The world cherishes and knows Italy for its flavorful, fresh cuisine. Equally basic and subtle, yet powerful and complex. Most Italian recipes share the use of savory Italian ingredients like olive oil, oregano, and basil. Many other countries have adopted them as ingredients for their own local dishes.The Italian Peninsula has been home to pizza for generations, but the iconic Margherita pizza originated in 1889 during a visit by Queen Margherita of Savoy to the city of Naples. According to legend, the queen called renowned pizza maker Raffaele Esposito because she was sick of French food and wanted him to prepare her a special pizza. Queen Margherita was pleased with the tomato sauce, mozzarella, and basil pizza. Raffaele Esposito immediately named his pizza Margherita and requested royal endorsement from the Queen.
