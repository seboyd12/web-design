   <p>It is hard to think of a country where art is more essential to the society as a whole than France. Throughout the Middle Ages, French art produced some of the greatest examples of Romanesque and Gothic architecture and art in history, giving France an exceptional legacy. The court painter Jean Clouet proudly embodied the French Renaissance era, and by the middle of the 17th century, Nicolas Poussin had taken on the role as the founding father of the French classical heritage. For many, the enchanting frivolity of Rococo marked the beginning of completely French art. However, the age of Enlightenment and the introduction of Neoclassicism, Romanticism, and Realism to the world's artists of a certain level eventually replaced it.
